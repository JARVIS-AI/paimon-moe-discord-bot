        note: "People often compare Sucrose with Venti for Crowd-Control capabilities, but that's not what you'll be looking for. Sucrose is a character that can give Elemental Mastery to her teammates through swirling the correct elements (Ascension 1 Talent), which improves reaction damage for the Characters benefitting from the EM boost. Her Ascension 4 Talent also boosts the entire team's EM by 20% of Sucrose's total EM, this is why you want to stack as much elemental mastery as possible in her artifacts. As a support, most of Sucrose's value lies on her Ascension 1 and 4 talents, hence leveling her other talents (Normal Attack, Skill, and Burst) is not required.\n\nRegarding Weapon Priority: It's important to note that these weapons were ranked based on how much EM they offered you. However, this doesn't take into account how much each catalyst benefits your entire team's DPS. It's worth noting that Thrilling Tales overtakes the other weapons on the list when it comes to enabling your team.\n\nRegarding Energy Recharge Priority: Ranking is based on the assumption that Sucrose has Sacrificial Fragments and is not valued for her Burst in teams that may not want Sucrose's Burst interfering with elemental auras. Energy Recharge could be prioritized higher when Sucrose is utilized in teams that don't really mind which element is being applied first and last (e.g. Electro Charge).",

This set gives a 20% partywide ATK boost after Jean casts her Elemental Burst.\nSet 4 provides more damage (and healing since her heals scale with ATK) for Jean. It's the go to set if you already have a 4 pc Viridescent Venerer user and/ or 4 pc Noblesse Oblige user on the team.\nSet 5 buffs her already huge burst multiplier even more. You can go for this set instead of Set 3 if you want more burst damage and don't need the extra heals.\n\nFor Support Jean, you can either go for more ATK for stronger heals, but relatively lower Burst uptime, or more ER for lower heals, but higher Burst uptime.

        tip: "Make sure you don't immediately swap away after casting Burst, you need to be on-field for VV 4-set perk to proc on swirl first.(E > Q to avoid this issue)\n\nYou can infuse elements onto Venti's Burst if you walk up with an element status on you. (e.g. Bennett Burst > Venti Burst > Walk up to infuse Pyro)\n\nCheck out this link to see which characters can hit the enemies sucked and ragdolled in Venti's burst. (Sheet has not been updated since Yanfei release)",
        note: "This build focuses on damage over ER because of his ER ascension stat. This weapon order is in the assumption of EM venti, specifics about EM vs Crit venti can be found below.\n\nThe amount of swirls his burst can achieve depends on how long the original element's aura lasts and how many enemies are inside the burst. If it's a single target, the element might expire before being infused into the burst. If you keep refresh the aura and ensure the infusion has been activated early in the burst's duration by reapplying the element, then it can swirl up to 7 times. This can be seen here.\n\nSwirl can only cause two instances of AoE damage per element per target for a single AoE skill. This means that if you have two or more enemies with Pyro auras, and Swirl them with an AoE ability, only two instances of Swirl Pyro damage will occur on each target. This results in a max of 14 swirl damage procs against a single target throughout a single Venti burst, per element. Different elements follow a separate \"two instance\" rule.\n\nWhen Venti's burst swirls Hydro, only 7 total instances of Swirl can be done on each enemy. This is due to Hydro Swirl not dealing damage in an AoE, which is a property exclusive to Hydro. However, if Electro is consistently applied to a Hydro-infused Venti burst with 2 or more enemies, Venti will instead deal 21 total instances of Swirl damage on each enemy (14 from the Electro aura, 7 from the Hydro aura). This means that in certain builds where swirling only hydro is necessary, it is still better to build crit than EM. Further analysis on swirl can be seen here.\n\nRegarding Skyward Harp: Skyward Harp becomes better if used in a pure crit build with Bennett. Crit build ONLY outperforms EM build on high constellation (C4-C6) Venti with the help of Bennett burst or C0 with unrealistic (~30% or above crit value substats per artifact) substats plus Bennett burst. Generally it is better to build EM on low constellation Venti.\n\nElegy for the End's ATK buff DOES NOT buff Venti's burst if Venti is the one equipping the bow, but the EM buff affects Venti's Swirl reaction. This is due to Venti's burst snapshotting his stats (excluding EM toward transformative reactions) at the time of cast. Swirl is considered a transformative reaction.",

        note: "Xiao has issues with Energy regeneration because he cannot generate any particles with his Elemental Skill while his Burst is active, so it is not suggested to use his Elemental Skill during Elemental Burst.\n\nStart off a fight by casting the skill of your Anemo Battery and then casting his skill twice (three times at C1) then cast your burst immediately. You will want to be half way through your burst animation before the particles reach you, so this way you can start off your burst with a portion of the energy gauge already filled. Same goes for any other Anemo Battery (recommended below), cast skill and swap back to Xiao to cast burst before the particles reach you.\n\nYou'll want to pair Xiao with another Anemo character (Venti, Sucrose, Jean or Anemo Traveler) to help him gain energy while his Elemental Burst is on cooldown. Xiao's Elemental Burst ends when you swap to another character. Although he has two charges of his Elemental Skill, only ONE charge comes back per cooldown.\n\nRegarding Weapon options: With a proper anemo battery (e.g. Sucrose), Xiao needs as little as 120-130% ER to maintain a high burst uptime. In these scenarios, unless there are no ERs from substats, you should always go for a non-ER weapon as it will result in more damage.",

Hence, swords with Energy Recharge substats are favoured over Iron Sting UNLESS KAZUHA IS IN A DUAL ANEMO TEAM.\n\nSimilar to Venti, due to the EM buffs, a triple EM build will out-damage a regular ATK || EM / Anemo / Crit build as long as there are 2+ enemies due to the amount of swirls involved. Because of this, we do not recommend building him with crit unless he is in a team whereby he cannot make use of his A4 passive or swirls. (i.e. mono anemo/geo teams)",

Additionally, her first constellation greatly increases her ultimate uptime, further lowering the healing needed.\n\nAs a support, Diona's typically used for three things; Shielding, Healing, and Cryo particle generation. Pairing Diona with Cryo carries such as Ganyu and Eula allows you to funnel energy into your DPS characters while providing them with quick shields for stagger resistance. Weapons such as Sacrificial Bow and Favonius Warbow greatly increase her potential as a battery.\n\nRegarding mainstat choices: Full Stack HP% is recommended if you want stronger shields but a weaker heal. Go for a HB Circlet if you want a nice balance between the two.\n\nRegarding Talent Priority: Prioritise whichever your Diona is geared for (shielder or healer), if built for a balance between the two, level both equally.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choice:\nSacrificial Bow VS Favonius Warbow: Sacrificial Bow wins, especially at higher refinements.\nFavonius Warbow: You will look to build some Crit Rate coverage to have a higher chance of triggering bow passive for energy.\nRecurve Bow: This bow will be your best choice for stronger shields, but it reduces Diona's burst uptime significantly due to no Energy Recharge on her weapon.",

        note: "Chongyun is much preferred as a Sub DPS/ Nuke over Main DPS as his Normal Attack scalings are very low, even when including Constellation 1. His Elemental Burst on the other hand hits extremely hard on later constellations and takes a much higher total damage portion over his Normal Attack. On top of that, you can Reverse Melt all 3 hits of his Elemental Burst on enemies applied with strong Pyro, such as Bennett's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.\n\nChongyun is very niche as he only performs well in certain teams and can completely destroy the other. He is mainly used on a team as an enabler, be it for Reverse Melt teams (e.g. Melt DPS Bennett) or Freeze teams (e.g. Freeze DPS Kaeya). He also does not function well with Physical teams (e.g. Razor, Eula) as it renders his Elemental Skill useless because it converts their Normal Attack damage from Physical to Cryo. They're usually using a Physical Goblet, so if they got their Normal Attack converted from Physical to Cryo, they won't benefit from Physical DMG Bonus from the goblet, thus it's a DPS loss.\n\nAt [C2], his Elemental Skill reduces ability cooldown that is casted within the zone by 15%. This is one of the few abilities in the game that can reduce cooldown.\n\nRegarding Sacrificial Greatsword: This weapon is your best choice if faced in a situation where you heavily rely on Chongyun's cryo infusion uptime (e.g. against Abyss Heralds). Current rankings are damage oriented.\n\nRegarding Noblesse Oblige (4): This set has the potential to outperform the other artifact sets in terms of teamwide DPS potential as Chongyun can achieve 100% buff uptime if he bursts off cooldown.\n\nRegarding Talent Priority:\nPrioritize Elemental Burst on a Melt team as it offers a huge DPS boost.\n\nPrioritize Elemental Skill on a Freeze team to furthermore extend the duration of the cryo infusion.",

This is because the 4-set effect of Gladiator's Finale does not stack with Crescent Pike's passive.\n\nRegarding Blizzard Strayer (4): It has been tested that Rosaria's Q is required to maintain uptime on 4pc blizzard strayer (due to fischl/beidou stealing cryo procs for superconduct). Due to the low uptime of Rosaria's Q at [C0] this artifact set should only be recommended at [C2+].",

This has high damage and energy sustainability while also be used outside of Freeze comps for a flat 20% Crit Rate against enemies with a Cryo status. A Hydro Support would be appreciated with Blizzard Strayer (4) Ganyu. Highly Recommended, especially for players who have Ganyu at C4.\n\nKeep in mind that for this set, Elemental Mastery is not going to be used at all.\n\nRegarding Wanderer's Troupe (4): is a set that focuses on maximizing Charged Shot damage with Reverse Melt since the initial hit and Bloom have a separate ICD which allows you to Reverse Melt both hits. Highly Recommended, as Xiangling, the best Pyro support for this team is easily accessible while also offering consistent damage output.\n\nKeep in mind that for this set, Ganyu's Burst will not be used at all since it interrupts with Reverse Melting her Charged Shot.\n\nRegarding Gladiator's Finale (2) Blizzard Strayer (2): is the generalist set, and provides an overall damage increase to all aspects to her kit. Recommended as a placeholder set.\n\nRegarding Retracing bolide(4): is an alternative to set 2 but ONLY if you pair ganyu with Zhongli. Zhongli is the only character in the game with permanent shield uptime on his own. Diona (sacrificial bow) still has downtime on her shield since the shield lasts 12 seconds on skill lvl 7+ (hold e) and sacrificial bow has a 30 second cooldown. Recommended as a placeholder set.\n\nRegarding Heart of Depth (4): is also an alternative to set 2 if you don't have Zhongli.

Use this set if you are only using her Burst and to support your main DPS.\n\nYou would want at least 140% ER with a support Ganyu, although from testing, with a DPS Ganyu at 111% ER, the ult uptime is already 100% so you don't have to invest a lot of stats into Energy Recharge explicitly, you want to focus more on Crit Rate/DMG and EM. The stats priority, Crit Rate/DMG and Elemental Mastery is interchangeable depending on what team comp you're using Ganyu as a support is in.

        note: "Eula's weapon rankings assume that you're running her with a cryo battery (i.e. Diona) instead of Bennett and that she has more than 30% ER substats from her artifacts alone. Increasing it to 40% through substats can help alleviate her energy issues.\n\nEula's burst does not snapshot. This means that any buffs Eula has upon casting burst will not be taken into effect if the buff duration expires before the Lightfall Sword hits.\n\nRegarding Pale Flame (4): This is Eula's optimal artifact set and it relies on having a condition fulfilled in order to outperform Pale Flame (2) + Bloodstained Chivalry (2). If you are able to sustain the conditional buff, you will be able to achieve a 50% Physical DMG Bonus + 18% Atk. Without using your Elemental Burst, you can sustain the Pale Flame's 4 set bonus because each stack lasts 7s and it refreshes per stack, and Eula's Elemental Skill is only 4s when doing 1-taps, therefore you can keep the condition up.\n\nWhen using this set, it is recommended to not use hold skill cast until your Lightfall Sword is nearly about to end. This restriction is only for players who don't have Eula C2 or above. Please visit the Ability Tips for her combo.\n\nRegarding Pale Flame (2) + Bloodstained Chivalry (2): This is a non-conditional, consistent artifact set that provides you a constant 50% physical dmg bonus. While that by itself is amazing, Pale Flame (4) can out perform this set because it also has an 18% atk buff and is easily maintained through her low tap skill cooldown.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choice:\nSerpent Spine: It can be better than Skyward Pride if you have at least 130% ER from substats and running a cryo battery. It is also worth noting that an R5 Serpent Spine will outperform all 5⭐ weapons at R1 with proper stack management.\nSkyward Pride: This weapon is more forgiving towards ER substats. If there is a cryo battery unit in your team (Diona with Sacrificial bow or Kaeya with Favonius Sword) or your team generates enough particles on their own, Skyward Pride loses effectiveness compared to the above options.",

        note: "Kamisato Ayaka is a pretty straightforward DPS that deals most of her damage from her Elemental Burst. She has very high scalings on her burst at the cost of it being expensive, which is 80 energy. This is the reason why you need another Cryo battery on the team to provide energy for her (Diona, Kaeya, Rosaria, etc). She has a special dash (like Mona) and after she dashes, she will get a Cryo infusion on her Normal Attacks. You'd want to play around her special dash to constantly deal Cryo damage on enemies from her Normal Attack.\n\nShe can be played on a permafreeze team (paired with a Hydro enabler such as Mona, Xingqiu, or even Barbara) where she could gain huge benefits from the Blizzard Strayer (4) artifact set. Blizzard Strayer (4) piece gives a huge amount of stats on a Freeze team, so try to get this artifact set as fast as you can. Her Elemental Burst also sticks on frozen enemies, but it also has a small hitbox so you need to position it well so that it can hit multiple bigger enemies.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nAquila Favonia (5⭐): While Aquila has Physical Damage% as a main stat, which is basically useless on Ayaka, it is still a good statstick as it got a high base ATK and ATK% buff from the passive.\nPrimordial Jade Cutter (5⭐): With Blizzard Strayer (4) and Cryo Resonance, this weapon overcrits, so avoid getting Crit Rate substats.\nSkyward Blade (5⭐), Blackcliff Longsword (4⭐), The Black Sword (4⭐), Amenoma Kageuchi (4⭐): These 4 weapons will give a similar output, so it's not worth getting or building another when you already have one. Depends on how much Energy Recharge you're running, how much stacks your Blackcliff has, how much time you're gonna spend doing Normal Attacks, and how much you value the passive on Amenoma since it gives you leeway in building Energy Recharge, one can be better than the other. If you're running Skyward Blade or Amenoma Kageuchi (especially with higher refines), avoid getting Energy Recharge substats. These 2 weapons (especially Skyward Blade) helps a lot for her to charge her Elemental Burst and allows for comfier Elemental Burst uptime and rotation.\nThe Flute (4⭐): This is a slightly better option than Amenoma Kageuchi if you do not benefit from Amenoma Kageuchi's passive (which is unlikely).",

        note: "[C1] is recommended to even start Fischl's DPS build, with Oz still contributing to Physical DPS even when he's off-field.\n\nThere is an animation cancelling technique with Fischl DPS. After 3 or 5 basic attacks, shoot an Aim Shot to reset your attack combo. The faster you can do this, the better it is. Only use this for animation cancelling when you're out of stamina since it can be pretty hard to replicate consistently.\n\nRegarding Fischl C6 Build: Starting C6, Oz will be dealing about 60% of the DPS and it'd be better to invest on Gladiator's Finale (2) Thundering Fury (2) until you can obtain Pale Flame (4) with an Electro Goblet.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choice\nMitternachts Waltz: Mitternachts Waltz would be prioritized over Amos if you manage to get refinement 5 for pure Physical build Fischl.\nViridescent Hunt: Viridescent Hunt is a really good investment that even surpasses Amos in a situation where there are crowds of enemies, although it's not as efficient towards massive single targets or really agile targets. It offers crowd DPS that is severely lacking due to Fischl's single target attacks.\nPrototype Crescent: If you manage to weave in a Charged Shot on enemy weak spots once every 9-10 seconds, Prototype Crescent could potentially offer more DPS, this weapon can be an option for those interested in a more challenging playstyle.",

Hopefully, by the time your second/third round of Oz summoning is over, you'll have gained enough energy to repeat the loop.\n\nRegarding Windblume's Ode:\nWindblume's ATK buff can be applied to Oz after burst through pressing your skill button after exiting bird form. This relocates Oz and reapplies the buff which is then snapshotted throughout the rest of its duration.\n\nRegarding Thundersoother (4): This artifact set will outperform Gladiator's Finale(2) Thundering Fury(2) if used in a team comp where an electro aura is always present (e.g. Electro/Electro-charged comps) therefore it is highly recommended within this niche.\n\nRegarding Gamblers (2): Similar to Albedo and defender's will, since this artifact set only goes up to 4 star quality, you should only use them in the Feather and Flower slot such that you do not lose out as much on offensive mainstats.\n\nRecommended amount of ER: 130-150%",

This is only recommended to those who have no immediate access to a decent Pale Flame set, otherwise you would be better off investing on Pale Flame pieces, regardless of weapon choice.\n\nRegarding Wolf's Gravestone: Wolf's Gravestone (inactive) outperforms Skyward Pride in every scenario except crowd battles.\n\nRegarding The Unforged: The playstyle with this weapon becomes a lot more comfortable without having to worry about snapshotting Wolf's Gravestone / Song of Broken Pines buffs for Sub DPSes, while also granting more Shield Bonus for better Shield uptime. A shielder is required for this, with Zhongli being the most ideal option.\n\nRegarding Serpent Spine: At C6, it is better to run an ATK% Goblet over Physical Damage% with Serpent Spine. This is due to the oversaturation of damage bonuses (ascension stat + Serpent Spine) in addition to the fact that Electro accounts for a significant portion of Razor's damage. An in-depth explanation can be found here. It is also worth noting that an R5 Serpent Spine with max stacks will outperform all 5⭐ weapons at R1.\n\nRegarding Skyward Pride: Skyward Pride is viable with a Physical DMG goblet, as the damage dealt through its passive scales with Physical%.",

        tip: "Ningguang's Burst generally does not land all 12 hits - one of the Star Gems from the Jade Screen usually slams into the ground before its homing can activate. This missed gem is important for Bolide vs Noblesse.\n\nSkill has a 6 second internal cooldown on generating Energy, so for the sake of maintaining Burst loops, wait 6 seconds to cast again if you need energy.\n\nScreen also breaks when casted on top of another Geo Structure, you can intentionally use a structure to break your first screen.",
        note: "The DPS Artifact set ranking order assumes C2 so that you have efficient energy generation with burst loops. If you don't have C2 and can't quickly regain your EB basically off cooldown, then full bolide set may be better.\n\nRegarding Retracing Bolide (4): This set is generally recommended for players with Ningguang constellations lower than 2. N1 > CA rotations are the most ideal for this set, to prevent stamina consumption you need to be close up to enemies so the Normal Attack hits before the CA animation starts.\n\nWalk through your Skill before using Burst for more damage. Normal Attack Animation Cancel is possible if you hold down on a walking direction and do Normal Attack before you start moving.\n\nNingguang C2 can reset Skill cooldown when Skill is used while there's an existing Jade Screen, shattering the existing Jade Screen and triggering the C2 perk. See example below:\nSkill Cast > Wait Skill CD (11s) > Skill Cast > C2 resets Skill CD > Skill Cast (Shatters Previous Barrier) > Wait C2 CD (6s) > Skill Cast (Shatters Previous Barrier)\n\nRegarding Dodoco Tales (4⭐): Generally, Dodoco Tales is outperformed by Widsith/Solar Pearl at R3, however with the right buffs, Widsith can match Dodoco Tales at lower refinements.\n\nRegarding Widsith/Solar Pearl: If your stats aren't balanced, then whichever weapon's substat is better for balancing you out at the 1:2 ratio (assuming C2) will outperform the other. For example, if you're at 50/70 from artifacts, The Widsith is ahead even with no Theme on charged attacks thanks to it pushing your crit damage high enough to overpower solar's crit rate. If your crit rate and crit damage are at 50/100 or 60/120 or similar balanced values, The Widsith is very slightly better so long as you get two good Themes in a row before EM themes, which on average is expected.\n\nA consistently updated sheet on the math behind Ningguang's weapon priority can be found here.",

        note: "SHIELDBOT\nThis kind of playstyle is very straightforward; stack as much HP as possible. Prioritize HP scaling polearms such as Black Tassel and artifact sets such as Tenacity of the Millelith to capitalize on Zhongli's Shield. A high refine Favonius Lance can be used over Black Tassel as the energy generated can be much more valuable compared to a slightly stronger shield.\n\n\nSUPPORT/NUKE\nZhongli's kit is best utilised as a Geo burst damage support for his short burst cool down (12s) and low energy cost (40 Energy), while his Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales his HP and at Ascension lv.4 you would unlock a talent that allows your burst to scale 33% of Max HP, making him an amazing source of shields and damage.\n\n\nComparison between Tenacity (4) and Noblesse (2) Archaic (2): Tenacity is recommended as top choice because of what it offers at a lower investment is just way too good, while at higher investments it won't be losing out a lot as it offers more utility instead of some extra DPS. Noblesse (2) Archaic (2) is only recommended for people who are willing to invest as much as they can for higher damage numbers.\n\nRegarding Favonius Lance Rankings: Zhongli's lackluster particle generation can be problematic in teams without a reliable source of geo energy. With sufficient energy/geo particles (i.e. in a dual Geo team) Lithic Spear and above will outperform Favonius Lance.\n\nIdeally, you'll want ATK% / Geo DMG Bonus / Crit Rate/DMG for maximum burst damage, as his Ascension 4 Talent scaling would be best benefitted using only one HP main stat, any additional HP stat is desirable as it goes to his shield durability/burst damage.\n\nNote that if paired with Xingqiu, the damage reduction from orbitals can be utilized on Zhongli's shield.",

However, Primordial Jade Winged-Spear offers more flexibility due to its Crit Rate sub-stat, allowing you to not stress over Crit Rate sub-stats in your artifacts. Switch between the two as you see fit.\n\nAlthough the damage Skyward Spine nets you is lacking compared to the other (5⭐) weapons, it does offer more upfront ER, allowing for easier burst rotations. Favonius Lance and Prototype Starglitter accomplish the same task. However, it's worth noting that ER becomes less important when considering a second pyro character for increased energy generation (IE bennett). Note that Xiangling require a bit less ER (150%-200% for example) in national/childe teams and a lot more ER (200-250% for example) in ganyu melt teams (or teams where xiangling isn't a reaction trigger) unless in specific 1 rotation setup.\n\nRegarding Dragon's Bane: Skyward Spine/Favonius Lance/Prototype Starglitter vs Dragon's Bane depends entirely on what team comp/artifacts you currently have. ER weapons offers more upfront ER while Bane offers more upfront EM, and a balanced mix is necessary. It's worth noting that a Dragon's Bane will easily outperform Favonius Lance, Spine, and Starglitter in a Vaporize-centered team composition.",

The combo for the highest Melt/Vaporize damage is The Black Sword and EM sand. R1 Iron Sting and EM sand turns out to have diminishing returns and isn't as good, but R2+ Iron Sting is a different question because better buffs. (Assuming you don't have a whale build's CR/CD stats, in which case Aquila with EM sands is just flat out better.)\n\nRegarding The Alley Flash: The Alley Flash has the potential to beat Iron sting R5, but this requires the passive to be up, whenever damaged, your passive is disabled for 5 seconds and you could be losing out a lot of damage, especially if you are constantly being damaged.\n\nRegarding Thundering Fury (4): This set works best if paired with Electro supports such as Beidou and Fischl/Lisa, as it allows Bennett to accomplish 2 things:\n1) Rapidly spam E for raw pyro damage + overload\n2) Generate tons of energy for the entire team.\nThundering Fury (4) also allows Bennett to quickly break the shields of the Abyss Lectors in the Spiral Abyss. This comp is generally only recommended for those with Beidou on C2/C6.\nIt's worth noting that the main-stat artifacts you want to farm for 4-TF Bennett varies from the main-stat artifacts you'd normally go for in other builds. Instead of ATK/EM, Pyro, and Crit, you'd instead want to go for EM/Pyro/EM on a 4-TF Bennett. As such, this also means weapons that have EM substats such as Iron sting take priority over other swords.\n\nIt is also worth noting that with 4 TF, Primordial Jade Cutter is able to overtake MIstsplitter Reforged due to its massive Crit Rate% substat, which allows you to vape consistently despite the lack of Crit Dmg/Crit Rate subs in your artifacts. This assumes that your EM mainstat pieces (sands, goblet, and circlet) lack Crit Rate substats. However, in the rare occasion that your EM pieces manage to roll plenty of Crit subs, Mistsplitter easily overtakes Jade Cutter.\nRecommended amount of ER%: 130-150%.

However, the Tenacity of the Millelith set gives her a new role with a lower Constellation level prerequisite.\n\nTenacity of the Millelith: This set gives Xinyan a unique role among the shielders. Currently, Xinyan is one of the few shielders in the game who can make full use of the Tenacity set's effects. If you can maximize the uptime of Xinyan's Level 3 shield, she can provide a constant 30% Shield Strength and 20% Atk boost to the team (as long as the pulses hit an enemy). This means that Sacrificial Greatsword and Xinyan's C2 are crucial to making this set shine on her. This set isn't as recommended for her if you have neither of the two.\n\nShield uptime is also crucial to maximizing her Physical/Shield Support capabilities. If you have neither Sacrificial Greatsword nor at least C2 (but ideally C4) on Xinyan, you may want to build her as a Burst Support instead of Physical/Shield Support.\n\nAt C2, her burst \"Riff Revolution\" has a 100% Crit Rate, which means you can build solely Crit Dmg (instead of trying to get a 1:2 Crit Rate:Crit DMG ratio) if you're building her as a Physical Burst support.\n\nGenerally not recommended for Pyro Applications, as the pulses only happen at Shield Level 3, and are not very efficient at breaking Cryo shields.",

        tip: 'You can interweave Normal Attacks while using his Elemental skill.\n\nie. ES -> NA -> NA -> ES -> NA -> NA -> ES -> NA -> NA',
        note: "Crimson Witch of Flames is generally the better choice with how easily Diluc can stack up for Pyro Damage, while his burst imbues his Normal/Charged Attacks with Pyro.\n\nGladiator's Finale is for those who are still reluctant on farming for Crimson Witch of Flames (Pre-AR 45), this will still provide it a fairly decent increase in DPS as he still relies on his Normal/Charged Attacks mostly.\n\nIf you're Constellation 2, refrain from using Serpent Spine as C2 requires you to take damage for the buff which counteracts with Serpent Spine's Stacks UNLESS Diluc is being used with Zhongli for consistent shield. Serpent Spine can lose its stacks if you take any damage, but taking hits with a shield on does not constitute as taking damage. Constellation 2 buff stacks up even if you take hits with a shield, which means that you can potentially stack up both constellation 2 buff and the serpent spine buff. This can only be performed consistently by a well invested Zhongli. (S1 means 1 Stack)\n\nIf Diluc is run alongside Xingqiu where he can trigger vaporize very often, you can run EM sands as an alternative to ATK sands. EM boosts diluc's reaction damage by a lot after all. Note that when Diluc's pyro imbued basic attack is active, he can trigger vaporize every 2 basic attacks due to internal cooldown. (vaporize, no vaporize, vaporize, no vaporize, etc.)\n\nLithic Blade is assumed to have 1 stack active bc you will almost definitely be running xingqiu with diluc in every situation.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choice:\nSerpent Spine: R5 serpent spine (with decent stack management) will outperform a R2 Wolf's gravestone.\nRainslasher: For obvious reasons, this weapon is only recommended when Diluc is in a team comp where he can consistently proc vaporize (i.e. when paired with Xingqiu). Rainslasher will also outperform Blackcliff Slasher at [R3+].",

        tip: 'Extremely squishy, Klee requires great positioning. Being tiny, this is hard to achieve. Constant jumping during your charged attacks can help.',
        note: "Attacks have a 50% chance of spawning a floating star. Floating star removes the stamina cost for the next Charged Attack and increases 50% of its damage, this gives us another DPS option (Wanderer's Troupe).\n\nGladiator's Finale and Crimson Witch of Flames hybrid is generally the easiest utilised build for general combat, as you get a straight increase of damage from your stats and Pyro Damage Bonus.\n\nCrimson Witch of Flames is best used against Cryo/Electro enemies as it increases the damage of your reactions, but the 4-set perk doesn't really get stacked efficiently as Klee's Elemental Skill takes quite a while to charge again, making it hard to have the set used at full capacity.\n\nKlee's kit makes it harder to utilize vaporize and melt the same way another pyro carry would, but her constant pyro application makes Lavawalkers a viable set. See Kleeful Frame's great number breakdown here\n\nWith her fantastic energy generation and ult uptime, 2 Noblesse becomes viable.\n\nRegarding Dodoco Tales: On equal refinements, Widsith and Solar Pearl are better than Dodoco Tales, but when assuming R5 Dodoco Tales vs R1-R3 Widsith/Pearl, Dodoco Tales is better. Note that Bennett buff / Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) buff will push Widsith and Solar Pearl above Dodoco Tales, even at low refinements.\n\nWanderer's Troupe increases the Charged Attack by another 35% Damage Bonus. It can serve as a decent DPS choice but due to how clunky Klee's attack animations are, it's hard to put this in actual practise as it requires you to dodge more and consume more stamina, not to mention how the DPS gets caught up by the 2 other builds mentioned above.",

        tip: "Use Hu Tao's Elemental Burst (Q) when your HP is below 50% (=/<50%), and use it when Hu Tao's Elemental Skill is about to end as to maximize its damage.\n\nFor more in depth information about Hu Tao, please check https://keqingmains.com/hu-tao/",
        note: "Important Note - Hu Tao is most effective when used with Xingqiu to proc Vaporize / Freeze Melt reactions which utilizes her BiS Set, Crimson Witch of Flames (4). Freeze Melt refers to freezing enemies for Melt set up.\n\nShimenawa's Reminiscence (4): Gives higher NA & CA damage than 4CW but lowers your burst damage which hurts your AoE damage, also if you're unable to burst it might cause survivability issues if you're not running a healer\nRetracing Bolide (4) and Wanderer's Troupe / Tenacity of the Millelith (2) + Crimson's Witch of Flame (2) is almost on equal footing because both of the sets have an equal overall damage output assuming you have 100% shield uptime when using Bolide (4). The difference is, you want to use 2/2 WT/CW when focusing on Nuking and better consistency, while 4 Bolide is for overall higher AA damage at the expense of lower burst damage, although inconsistent if you cannot keep your shield permanently.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choice:\nPrimordial Jade Winged-Spear: Instead of spending time stacking and maintaining your weapon passive, you can start off with full damage potential on Dragon's Bane (4⭐) for Vaporize Nuke/DPS which gives faster clear times in realistic situations.\nRegarding Deathmatch: Deathmatch is better than Dragon's Bane when you're not doing Vaporize DPS. It is highly recommended to play for Vaporize/Freeze Melt DPS.\nVortex Vanquisher and Skyward Spine: provide little to nothing to Hu Tao since Hu Tao scales better with HP% than Atk% with every spear in the game. Base attack makes little difference on Hu Tao because Hu Tao has a very high HP to ATK conversion cap. It is so high that even a 3 star weapon's base attack is enough.",
